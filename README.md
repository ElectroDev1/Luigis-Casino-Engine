# Luigis-Casino

Thank you for downloading Luigi's Casino.

--GENERAL INFO--

This is a reimagining of the Luigi Table games from New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario 64 DS, my goal is to remake them, while
also translating them into a widescreen format with new assets and new options.

There isn't really a porpuse for this it's mostly me trying to remake things because I kinda like doing that.


--RELEASE(s) INFO--

this is the first public version of the project file, it already includes most of the basic stuff and Memory Match has been finished,
